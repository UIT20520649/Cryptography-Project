# Efficient and Secure File Transfer in Cloud Through Double Encryption Using AES and RSA Algorithm

## Abstract
Cloud services are already hiring information thanks to recent developments in cloud computing. Users may get low-cost storage using cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive. Here, we give a security mechanism that offers a higher level of protection by encrypting and decrypting the files. The file that we upload to the cloud is encrypted using the double encryption approach. The two techniques are used sequentially to encrypt the file twice.
The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the file after the AES method. The corresponding keys are being created during the execution of the algorithm. The level of security is raised by this method. Security level, speed, data secrecy, data integrity, and cipher text size are some of the different factors that we have taken into consideration here.
